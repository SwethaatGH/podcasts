# College Podcasts
The application helps centralise audio podcasts of guest lectures, alumni talks and awareness program discussions happening at colleges. Due to academic or personal commitments, students or professors often find it impractical to attend in-person meetings. This approach will enable students and staff to access these insightful talks conveniently and at their preferred time, thus ensuring a comprehensive and inclusive learning experience.

Users can view podcasts and episodes within podcasts. Audio interfacing is supported and thus users can listen, play, pause and reset audios. 

## Tech Stack Used
This application was developed using JAVA SWING for GUI - frontend and SQL for backend. JUnit was used for **testing purposes**.
All the texts and images involved are fetched from database.
